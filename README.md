(Hack has no name yet)

This is my first hack, so please be kind :3
<details>
  <summary>My goal is to create my "dream hack"</summary>

  Starting 2021, I started playing a lot of romhacks
  Mid-2022, I discovered Pokemon Unbound, which I have found to be the best romhack I ever played.
  I tried at the time creating a hack, but it was really bad, and more of a test game than a real hack.
  I now have a way better (still bad, but at least I know where to look when changing something lol) understanding of how the C language, GBA, the decomps... work.
  The creation of this hack is heavily inspired by Skeli's Pokemon Unbound. Even though I doubt I will ever come close to reach such a level of romhacking, my main goal is learning romhacking and relateds. If people end up enjoying this, that will be more than I ever wished :')

------
I do not plan on adding new mons or forms, as I believe there is so much unexploited "vanilla" content that I won't ever need to add that kind of content to a game :)
